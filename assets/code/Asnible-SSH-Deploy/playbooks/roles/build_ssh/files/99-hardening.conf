# 99-hardening.conf â€” Misc hardening
#
# Purpose:
#   Disable per-user environment injection via ~/.ssh/environment and the
#   `environment=` option in authorized_keys. This prevents users from altering
#   PATH, LD_* vars, or other env that could weaken security for their sessions.
#
# Notes:
#   - Loaded late (99-*) so it wins over any earlier fragments.
#   - If you *need* to pass specific env vars, prefer the system-wide knobs:
#       AcceptEnv FOO BAR        # from client to server (whitelist)
#       SetEnv VAR=value         # server-defined env
#     Place those in an earlier fragment to keep intent clear.
# ==============================================================================

# Do not read user-provided environment files or authorized_keys env options
