# Hardening Your Robot Project from the Start

As robotics becomes more accessible and developers take the leap into building their own intelligent machines, the importance of security cannot be overstated. Whether you're tinkering with your first robot at home or developing a prototype for industrial use, it's critical to think beyond just getting ROS2 installed and your nodes communicating.

Welcome to the first post in a new series focused on securing your ROS2 environment — starting from the ground up, at the Linux OS level. This guide is crafted to walk you through practical and effective steps to immediately improve the security posture of your robot projects. Our goal is to empower builders and developers to safeguard their work from common attack vectors without getting lost in complexity.

## 🛡️ Why Create This Series

There’s no shortage of great tutorials out there that walk you through setting up ROS2, spinning up topics, or launching nodes. But once you have ROS2 up and running, what comes next? How do you ensure your system isn’t just functional, but *secure*?

Robots are complex systems with internal hardware communication and often external network access. These connections—if left unsecured—can become points of vulnerability. Especially when you're dealing with expensive hardware or devices that interact with the real world, protecting your infrastructure becomes essential.

This series aims to fill that gap—bridging the world of ROS2 functionality with practical cybersecurity strategies.
