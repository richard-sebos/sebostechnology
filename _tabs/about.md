From the moment I laid eyes on a personal computer in my teens, I knew these gadgets were going to revolutionize the way we work, live, and play. My journey began in those buzzing early days of PCs, sparking a lifelong love affair with technology.

For over two decades, I turned my passion for programming into a thriving career. But deep down, I've always been a tinkerer at heart. üõ†Ô∏è

Fast forward to the year 2000, I discovered the magic of Linux and virtual machines--though running a VM at home was just a dream back then. Thankfully, tinkering with Linux became a professional gig and a personal pastime that I still enjoy today.

My home lab adventures began with VirtualBox, playing around with virtual environments for years. About seven years ago, I snagged an old server (yep, the jet-engine sounding kind üöÄ) and stumbled upon Proxmox. It‚Äôs been my go-to ever since, helping me explore the endless possibilities of virtualization--thankfully, on much quieter hardware now!

Early in my IT career, I embraced the ethos of being an artisan in technology. Strange as it may sound, this woodworking concept is about mastering the fine details that transform good work into greatness. This approach is not just about crafting wood but also sculpting robust, secure IT solutions.

I bring this artisanal spirit to my other passion--cooking! üç≥ It's amazing how a little extra effort can transform a good dish into a culinary masterpiece. Similarly, in IT, that same meticulousness can significantly enhance usability, reusability, and security.

Joining this platform allows me to share my knowledge and passion, hoping to inspire you to craft your artisan solutions in tech and beyond. Let‚Äôs make every byte and every bite count!
