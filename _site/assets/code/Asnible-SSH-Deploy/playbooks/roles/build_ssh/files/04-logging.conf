# ==============================================================================
# 04-logging.conf — SSHD logging & audit
#
# Purpose:
#   Ensure SSH activity is logged to the secure facility with sufficient detail
#   for troubleshooting and security auditing.
#
# Notes:
#   - On RHEL/Oracle Linux, AUTHPRIV logs go to /var/log/secure by default.
#   - VERBOSE logs key fingerprints on login and disallows (useful for audits).
#   - Avoid DEBUG/DEBUG3 in production; they are very noisy and can leak data.
# ==============================================================================

# Send SSH logs to the “secure” syslog facility (AUTHPRIV)
SyslogFacility AUTHPRIV

# Log more detail than INFO (includes key fingerprints, auth failures, etc.)
LogLevel VERBOSE

# Show last login time to users (useful signal; also logged)
PrintLastLog yes

# (optional) many distros print MOTD elsewhere; keep it quiet here if desired
# PrintMotd no

# (debugging only) temporarily increase detail while investigating an issue
# LogLevel DEBUG
# LogLevel DEBUG3
