  <summary>Introduction

When I first encountered the idea of tunneling SSH traffic over Tor, two things came to mind: it sounded incredibly cool—and frustratingly complex. There was also a sense that it might edge me a little closer to feeling like a hacker. This article walks through how SSH over Tor works, how I set it up myself, and whether it’s actually practical… or merely a tinfoil‑hat experiment.

  <summary>Introduction

In a previous phase of this robotics project, Suricata was installed as part of the initial system build. At that stage, only a few basic rules were added for initial monitoring purposes. Now that the core application stack is largely in place, it’s time to take a deeper look into how the robot is interacting with the network. Understanding these interactions is critical not only ...</summary>

  <summary>What Is a Jump Server (or Bastion Host)?

If you’re running multiple Linux servers in your homelab or a small network, having a centralized way to access them can save a lot of time and improve security. This is where a jump server—also called a bastion host—comes into play.

A jump server acts as a secure gateway between your workstation and your internal systems. Instead of connecting to each...</summary>

  <summary>Introduction

When setting up a new Linux server, it’s common practice to configure SSH authentication using public keys. Often, these keys are reused indefinitely—sometimes for weeks, months, or even years. While SSH keys provide a robust layer of security, they can also introduce risk if not managed properly. Unlike passwords, SSH keys are not usually rotated or set to expire, leading to a fa...</summary>
