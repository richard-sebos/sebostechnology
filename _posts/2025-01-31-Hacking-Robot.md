Alright, let’s set the record straight—I don’t *hate* the Raspberry Pi. In fact, some of my earliest projects were built on one. But this time, I want something **more** than a Raspberry Pi project that just *happens* to have some hacking capabilities. I want to build a **serious** hacking robot—something autonomous, mobile, and packed with real security tools.  

So, let’s dive into the plan!

## 🎯 **The Mission: Build a Real Ethical Hacking Robot**  

The goal is to create a **fully autonomous, mobile security auditing bot** that can:  
✅ Scan its environment using **AI-based vision & LiDAR**.  
✅ Detect and track **Wi-Fi & Bluetooth** signals.  
✅ Map physical spaces and **log security vulnerabilities**.  
✅ Use **GPS for precise tracking & logging**.  
✅ Securely send data to a base server over **VPN, Wi-Fi, or 5G**.  
✅ Support **mesh networking (Meshtastic)** for real-time data sharing.  
✅ Operate in a **defense mode**, alerting when security threats are detected.  

### 🔧 **The Plan**  

| **Phase**    | **Tasks** |  
|-------------|----------|  
| 🔹 **Step 1:** Choose Hacking Hardware | Select and configure ethical hacking tools (Wi-Fi sniffers, SDRs, GPS modules, etc.). |  
| 🔹 **Step 2:** Design the Mobile Base | Pick a platform that can carry all this gear. |  
| 🔹 **Step 3:** Power & Weight Calculation | Determine power consumption and weight distribution. |  
| 🔹 **Step 4:** Build & Integrate | Assemble everything into a working, mobile hacking robot. |

## 🏗️ **Project Blueprint**  

💡 **Project Name:** Autonomous Ethical Hacking Robot (**AEHR**)  
📅 **Estimated Completion:** 12 months  
💰 **Budget:** $2,000 - $5,000  
⚖️ **Goal Weight:** Light enough to **carry with one hand** and bring to work (because why not?).
