One of the key software technologies needed for my [Ethical Hacking Robot](https://dev.to/sebos/hacking-robot-needed-raspberry-pi-need-not-apply-49l6) is **ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2)**. ROS2 is a powerful middleware framework that allows developers to create modular software components that integrate with hardware. It has been widely adopted by **hobbyists, enterprises, and government agencies** for robotics development.

## **How Does ROS2 Work?**  

ROS2 is installed as an application on an existing operating system, such as **Ubuntu**. It provides a structured environment to build robotic applications using:  

- **Topics** â€“ Real-time data streaming using a **publish-subscribe** model.  
- **Services** â€“ One-time request-response calls.  
- **Actions** â€“ Long-running tasks with feedback.  
- **Parameters** â€“ Configuration values that can be modified at runtime.  
- **Lifecycle Nodes** â€“ Ensuring a safe startup and shutdown of components.  
- **TF (Transforms)** â€“ Managing robot coordinate frames.  
- **Logging** â€“ Debugging and monitoring system performance.  

These components work together to perform robotic actions. For example, a **navigation action** might use a **topic** to provide location data while interacting with a **wheel control service** to move the robot.  

So, where do we start after installing ROS2? Letâ€™s begin by developing a **WiFi Scanner**â€”a crucial feature for an ethical hacking robot.

## **WiFi Scanner: The First Step**  

Since my larger project involves creating a hacking robot, the first step was developing a **WiFi scanning tool**. I wrote a Python script that:  

- Scans for available WiFi **SSIDs (network names)**.  
- Stores them in a database for future analysis.  
- Can be triggered manually, through a **systemd timer**, or as a **ROS2 Topic**.  

In the future, I envision the robot combining **GPS and WiFi scanning** to map out WiFi networks along with their signal strength.  

---

## **Publishing WiFi Networks as a ROS2 Topic**  

For the robot to be aware of **active WiFi networks**, I created a **ROS2 Topic** to publish available networks in real-time.  

### **Setting Up the ROS2 Workspace**  

First, create a ROS2 workspace and package for the WiFi scanner:  

```bash
# Create the workspace
mkdir -p /opt/robot_ros/wifi/src
cd /opt/robot_ros/wifi/src

# Create a ROS2 package
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python wifi_scanner
```

This will generate the following directory structure:  

```
src
â””â”€â”€ wifi_scanner
    â”œâ”€â”€ resource
    â”œâ”€â”€ test
    â””â”€â”€ wifi_scanner
```

### **Creating the WiFi Scanner Node**  

Inside `src/wifi_scanner/wifi_scanner/`, I implemented a **ROS2 node** that scans and publishes WiFi networks every 5 seconds.  

```python
import sys
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from std_msgs.msg import String
import json

# Import the scanning code
sys.path.append('/opt/robot/wifi_scanner/scanner')
from scanner import WiFiScanner  # Assuming your scanner script is named wifi_scanner.py

class WiFiScannerNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('wifi_scanner_node')
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'wifi_scanner', 5)
        self.timer = self.create_timer(5.0, self.scan_and_publish)  # Scan every 5 seconds
        self.get_logger().info("WiFi Scanner Node has been started.")

    def scan_and_publish(self):
        networks = WiFiScanner.scan()
        networks_data = [network.__dict__ for network in networks]
        msg = String()
        msg.data = json.dumps(networks_data)
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        self.get_logger().info(f"Published {len(networks)} WiFi networks.")

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = WiFiScannerNode()
    rclpy.spin(node)
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### **Defining the Entry Point in setup.py**  

To let ROS2 know which script to execute, update the `setup.py` file inside `src/wifi_scanner/`:  

**Before:**  
```python
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
    ],
},
```

**After:**  
```python
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        'wifi_node = wifi_scanner.wifi_node:main',
    ],
},
```

---

## **Building and Running the ROS2 WiFi Scanner**  

Now that the code is in place, let's build the package:  

```bash
# Navigate back to the ROS workspace
cd /opt/robot_ros/wifi

# Build the package
colcon build --packages-select wifi_scanner
source install/setup.bash
```

To start the WiFi scanner node:  

```bash
ros2 run wifi_scanner wifi_node
```

To verify that the topic is being published, list all available ROS2 topics:  

```bash
ros2 topic list
```

You should see:  
```
/wifi_scanner
```

The topic name **`/wifi_scanner`** is defined in the Python script:  

```python
self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(String, 'wifi_scanner', 10)
```

To test the topic, use:  

```bash
ros2 topic echo /wifi_scanner
```

Example output:  

```
data: '[{"bssid": "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX", "ssid": "Network1", "channel": 1, "rate": "54 Mb/s", "bars": 5, "secure": "WPA2"}]'
```

## **Practical Use Cases: Why a WiFi Scanning Robot?**  

From my experience working with **warehouse environments**, one major issue is **WiFi dead zones**â€”areas where connectivity drops. A robot with a WiFi scanner could:  

- Traverse a warehouse and **map WiFi coverage** at different bin locations.  
- Identify weak signal areas and **optimize access point placement**.  
- Assist IT teams in troubleshooting **connectivity issues**.  

Beyond warehouses, other potential applications include:  

- **Security Audits** â€“ Identifying rogue access points in an office environment.  
- **Smart Cities** â€“ Mapping **public WiFi** coverage areas.  
- **Disaster Recovery** â€“ Deploying a robot to find working networks in disaster-stricken areas.  

## **Next Steps**  

Now that we have a working WiFi scanner, the next steps include:  

- Integrating **GPS data** to map WiFi networks geographically.  
- Enhancing security analysis to detect **open vs. secured networks**.  
- Automating **WiFi signal strength monitoring** for network optimization. 
### **What Would You Use a WiFi-Scanning Robot For?**  


This is just the beginning of building a **fully autonomous hacking robot**. Stay tuned for more updates! ðŸš€  

Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts! How would you use a robot that can scan for WiFi networks?
