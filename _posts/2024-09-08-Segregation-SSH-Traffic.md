In today‚Äôs fast-paced, automation-driven environments, **SSH traffic** is the backbone of countless administrative and deployment tasks. From powerful tools like **Ansible**, **rsync**, and **Terraform** to container platforms like **Docker**, these services generate a significant amount of SSH traffic.

If this traffic isn‚Äôt properly managed, it can lead to security blind spots, noisy logs, and operational inefficiencies. That‚Äôs why **segregating SSH traffic by service and user type** is a simple yet highly effective way to improve both security and performance.

In this guide, you‚Äôll learn how to:

* Separate SSH traffic using different ports.
* Apply advanced SSH configuration with the `Match` directive.
* Optimize firewall rules and logs for easier management.
* Improve Ansible automation performance with connection tuning.

## üìö **Why Segregate SSH Traffic?**

Segregating SSH traffic allows you to:

* **Implement tighter access controls.**
* **Streamline firewall configurations.**
* **Enhance monitoring and log analysis.**
* **Improve automation tool performance.**

For example, you may want regular user traffic on **port 22** while directing automation tools like **Ansible** through **port 2222**. This way, you can apply different security settings and logging levels to each traffic type without conflict.

---

## üîß **Using the SSH Match Statement**

The `Match` directive in `sshd_config` allows you to apply specific configurations based on conditions such as:

* `Match User` ‚Äì Match specific SSH users.
* `Match Group` ‚Äì Apply settings based on user groups.
* `Match Address` ‚Äì Filter by client IP address.
* `Match Host` ‚Äì Filter by hostname.
* `Match LocalPort` ‚Äì Apply settings based on the SSH port.
* `Match RemoteAddress` ‚Äì Filter based on the client‚Äôs IP.
* `Match RemotePort` ‚Äì Filter based on the client‚Äôs connection port.

In our scenario, we‚Äôll use `Match LocalPort` to separate traffic across ports **22** and **2222**.

## üóÇÔ∏è **Organizing SSH Configuration Files**

To make management easier, we‚Äôll split the SSH configuration into separate files:

1. **Main `sshd_config`** ‚Äì Common global settings.
2. **User Traffic Config (`55-ssh-user.conf`)** ‚Äì Rules for human users.
3. **Ansible Traffic Config (`51-ansible_admin.conf`)** ‚Äì Optimized for Ansible and automation tools.

This modular approach helps you maintain clean and targeted configurations without cluttering a single config file.

---

## üöÄ **Optimizing Ansible Traffic on Port 2222**

Ansible traffic typically generates many SSH sessions during playbook execution. You can improve both security and performance by:

* Restricting access to specific users and IP addresses.
* Setting **LogLevel** to `ERROR` to reduce log noise.
* Lowering `ClientAliveInterval` for faster detection of dropped sessions.
* Increasing `MaxSessions` to allow more parallel SSH connections.

### ‚û§ **Example: `51-ansible_admin.conf`**

```ssh
Match LocalPort 2222
    AllowUsers ansible_admin@192.168.167.17
    DenyGroups ssh-users
    ClientAliveInterval 60
    ClientAliveCountMax 3
    LogLevel ERROR
    MaxSessions 10
```

---

## üë§ **Managing User Traffic on Port 22**

For regular user SSH sessions, security and detailed logging take priority:

* Restrict SSH access to the `ssh-users` group.
* Increase `ClientAliveInterval` to reduce keep-alive traffic.
* Enable **INFO-level logging** for better activity tracking.
* Limit concurrent sessions to prevent resource abuse.

### ‚û§ **Example: `55-ssh-user.conf`**

```ssh
Match LocalPort 22
    AllowGroups ssh-users
    ClientAliveInterval 300
    ClientAliveCountMax 0
    LogLevel INFO
    MaxSessions 10
```

## üìà **Benefits of SSH Traffic Segregation**

* ‚úÖ Simplifies **firewall rule management**.
* ‚úÖ Helps **reduce log clutter** by customizing log levels.
* ‚úÖ Improves **security** with tailored access controls.
* ‚úÖ Enhances **Ansible performance** through optimized SSH parameters.
* ‚úÖ Makes **troubleshooting easier** by filtering logs based on port usage.

## üìñ **FAQ: SSH Traffic Segregation**

**Q1: Is changing the SSH port enough to improve security?**
While changing the port isn‚Äôt a complete security measure, it reduces automated bot attacks and, when combined with proper controls, strengthens your SSH defense.

**Q2: Can I apply similar segregation for other tools?**
Yes! This method works for any tool using SSH, including rsync, Git over SSH, and custom scripts.

**Q3: Does this affect my existing Ansible playbooks?**
No. You simply need to update the Ansible inventory to specify the new port using `ansible_port=2222`.

## üì¢ **Final Thoughts**

Segregating SSH traffic is a low-cost, high-reward strategy that makes managing a secure and high-performance environment easier. Whether you‚Äôre optimizing for automation tools like Ansible or ensuring detailed logging for user activities, this approach gives you granular control over how SSH connections are handled.
