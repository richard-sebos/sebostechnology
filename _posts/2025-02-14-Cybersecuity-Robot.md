## **Introduction**  
Cybersecurity and robotics are two rapidly evolving fields, yet their intersection remains largely unexplored. As robots become more advanced and widely used in industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics, their security risks also increase. Many robotic systems today lack proper authentication, encryption, and access control mechanisms, making them vulnerable to cyber threats. This project aims to address those challenges by developing a **ROS2-based autonomous robot designed specifically for ethical hacking and cybersecurity research**.

## **Why I Started This Project**  
My interest in both **robotics and cybersecurity** led me to identify a major gapâ€”most robots are built for functionality, not security. While ROS2 offers improvements over its predecessor, it still has vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. I wanted to create a project that not only demonstrates **secure robotic design** but also serves as a **penetration testing tool** for evaluating real-world robotic threats. By building this robot, I hope to provide a platform that researchers and ethical hackers can use to explore **cyber-physical security challenges** and develop better defenses for robotic systems.  

## **What Iâ€™m Building**  
This project is a **ROS2-based autonomous cybersecurity robot** designed for **ethical hacking** and **penetration testing**. It consists of multiple ROS2 nodes, each responsible for different functions such as perception, navigation, and network security testing. The robot operates under **Zero Trust Security principles**, meaning that every component must authenticate itself before communication occurs. Unlike traditional robots that prioritize movement and task execution, this robot is designed to actively **identify, test, and secure** vulnerabilities in robotic systems.  

## **How Security is Integrated**  
To ensure this robot can be used for both **ethical hacking and real-world security applications**, several security layers are integrated into its design:  

- **Identity Verification:** Every ROS2 node must authenticate itself before communicating with others, preventing unauthorized access.  
- **End-to-End Encryption:** ROS2 messages are protected using **SROS2 and DDS security**, ensuring secure data transmission between nodes.  
- **Access Control:** Only authorized users and processes can interact with the system, limiting potential attack vectors.  
- **Threat Detection:** AI-powered anomaly detection is used to monitor system behavior in real time, identifying potential cyber threats.  

These features allow the robot to **simulate attacks**, **detect vulnerabilities**, and **test countermeasures**, making it a valuable tool for **robotic security research and penetration testing**.  

## **How You Can Use This Project**  
If youâ€™re an **ethical hacker, security researcher, or robotics developer**, this project can serve as a **real-world testing platform** for securing autonomous systems. As robots become more integrated into **industrial automation, autonomous vehicles, and IoT environments**, the need for **robust cybersecurity** grows. This project provides insights into **securing robotic communications, detecting cyber threats, and implementing Zero Trust Security models**.  

Additionally, I plan to share **code, tutorials, and case studies** to help others apply these security practices to their own projects. Whether youâ€™re interested in **robotic security, ROS2 hacking, or cyber-physical penetration testing**, this project will offer valuable resources and insights.  

## **Join Me on This Journey**  
This is just the beginning of an exciting journey into **robotics and cybersecurity**. I will be documenting every step, from initial development to testing and deployment. Along the way, Iâ€™ll tackle challenges, experiment with new security models, and refine the robotâ€™s capabilities.  

If youâ€™re working on **ROS2 security, ethical hacking, or robotic penetration testing**, Iâ€™d love to collaborate and exchange ideas. Letâ€™s work together to build a safer, more secure robotic future! ðŸš€
