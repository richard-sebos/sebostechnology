In our [previous post](https://dev.to/sebos/securing-ros-2-with-apparmor-and-auditd-a-practical-guide-16fb), we configured the firewall and granted `$PROGRAMMER_LAPTOP_IP` access to the robot via SSH. But controlling a robot involves more than just external connections‚Äî**a robot is a complex ecosystem of internal components**, including a base controller, cameras, scanners, and movement modules. These components (ROS2 *nodes*) must communicate securely with each other.

So, how do we **secure internal communication between ROS2 nodes**?

## Why Node-to-Node Security Matters

In robotic systems powered by **ROS2**, nodes constantly exchange data‚Äîsome of it sensitive, such as movement commands or camera feeds. **Without encryption and access control**, this data is vulnerable to tampering or eavesdropping, especially in networked environments like factories or research labs.

That's where **SROS2** comes in.

---

## What Is SROS2?

**SROS2 (Secure ROS2)** extends ROS2 with **security mechanisms** built on the DDS-Security standard. It uses **OpenSSL** to encrypt node communication and restrict access based on signed permissions.

When configured, SROS2 creates a **keystore directory** containing:

- A **Certificate Authority (CA)**
- Each node's:
  - Public certificate
  - Private key
  - Signed permissions file

This setup ensures **only authorized nodes** can participate in the ROS2 ecosystem.

---

## SROS2 Setup Script Overview

To streamline setup, we created a script: `sros2_setup()`. This **Bash function initializes a keystore and configures a node (`base_controler`) for secure communication**.

It assumes:
- A working ROS2 installation
- ROS2 user and workspace set in an external script (`common.sh`)

---

## Step-by-Step: `sros2_setup()` Bash Function

### 1. Install OpenSSL

```bash
apt install -y openssl
```

üîß *Ensures the required cryptographic tools are available for SROS2 key generation.*

---

### 2. Switch to ROS2 User

```bash
sudo -u "$ROS_USER" bash -c '...'
```

üèÉ *Executes setup in the context of the non-root ROS2 user.*

Inside the block:

#### a. Source the ROS2 Environment

```bash
source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash
```

üîó *Loads the ROS2 environment variables.*

#### b. Create the Keystore Directory

```bash
mkdir -p $ROS_WS/sros2_keystore
```

#### c. Initialize the Keystore and Create Keys

```bash
ros2 security create_keystore $ROS_WS/sros2_keystore
ros2 security create_key $ROS_WS/sros2_keystore base_controler
```

üîê *Generates a secure identity for the `base_controler` node.*

---

### 4. Define Node Permissions

Create a file with the following XML content:

```xml
<permissions>
  <grant name="base_controler_grant" subject_name="CN=base_controler">
    <validity>
      <not_before>2025-01-01T00:00:00</not_before>
      <not_after>2027-01-01T00:00:00</not_after>
    </validity>
    <allow rule="ALLOW">
      <domains>
        <id>0</id>
      </domains>
      <topics>
        <topic>*</topic>
      </topics>
      <partitions>
        <partition>*</partition>
      </partitions>
    </allow>
  </grant>
</permissions>
```

üìú *This permission file grants the `base_controler` node access to all topics in domain ID 0.*

---

### 5. Generate Signed Permissions File

```bash
ros2 security create_permission $ROS_WS/sros2_keystore base_controler
```

‚úçÔ∏è *Signs the permissions file using the CA to make it valid and enforceable.*

---

## Security Context Summary

With this function, we now have:

‚úÖ A **keystore initialized** for SROS2  
‚úÖ A **certificate and key pair** for the `base_controler` node  
‚úÖ A **signed permission file** allowing communication  
‚úÖ **End-to-end encryption** for internal robot node communication

Combined with previous security steps‚Äî**AppArmor**, **Auditd**, and **firewall configuration**‚Äîwe're building a layered security model for our robot.

## Next Steps: Intrusion Detection with Suricata

Now that encrypted communication is set up within the robot's internal architecture, the next step is to **detect anomalies or intrusions at the network level**. In our next article, we‚Äôll integrate **Suricata**, an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS), to monitor traffic and alert on suspicious behavior.

Stay tuned üëÄ
