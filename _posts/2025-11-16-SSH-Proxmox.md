  alt: Hardened SSH access to Proxmox using a jump box and Yubikey-based MFA in a segmented home lab network
---

Virtualization tech — once locked away in enterprise data centers — now powers all kinds of home labs. I use mine for learning, tinkering, and running services like Proxmox VE. Whether you’re running a homelab business, learning cybersecurity, or just self-hosting your media, one thing tends to come up: **secure access to the hypervisor**.

A reader recently asked best practices for SSH and Proxmox. This guide is my answer. I’ll walk through the exact setup I use — including my jump box, SSH hardening, hardware-backed keys, and how I work with QubesOS to manage everything securely.

> While this is based on how I use Proxmox, most of the techniques apply to other virtualization platforms or Linux systems in general.

## Why I Use SSH with Proxmox

Proxmox has a great web interface. But like most hypervisors, it also gives you full command-line access. I like having SSH available because:

* It gives me more control than the web UI
* I can automate tasks and manage the server remotely
* I can shut down the web interface entirely when I don’t need it

That said, SSH also creates a potential attack surface — especially if you're exposing it on a local or public network. My solution is to keep SSH tightly locked down, route access through a hardened jump box, and enforce hardware-backed MFA using a Yubikey.

## 🔧 Part 1: Locking Down SSH on the Jump Box and Proxmox

The first step in my setup was to isolate Proxmox and the VMs onto a separate subnet, completely segmented from the rest of my home network. Then, I created a **jump box** — a small Linux VM on the same subnet as Proxmox — that acts as the only allowed entry point.

From there, I hardened SSH on both the jump box and the Proxmox server using the following settings.

### 🔐 My SSHD Configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`)

```bash
# -- Authentication Controls --
PermitRootLogin no
AllowGroups ssh-users
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
PubkeyAuthentication yes
StrictModes yes
UsePAM yes

# -- Brute Force Protection --
MaxAuthTries 3
MaxStartups 3:30:10
LoginGraceTime 0

# -- Logging --
LogLevel VERBOSE
PrintLastLog yes
Banner /etc/ssh/sshd-banner

# -- Session Control --
ClientAliveInterval 300
ClientAliveCountMax 0
TCPKeepAlive no

# -- Forwarding & Tunneling --
AllowAgentForwarding no
AllowStreamLocalForwarding no
PermitTunnel no
GatewayPorts no
X11Forwarding no
```

I apply this configuration to **every server I SSH into**, including the jump box and Proxmox. Here’s what this setup gets me:

* 🚫 No root logins or passwords
* 🔑 Key-only authentication for users in the `ssh-users` group
* 🔐 No agent forwarding, no X11, and no tunnels
* 🛡️ Login timeouts and brute-force mitigation
* 📜 Verbose logging for auditing

### 📴 Disabling the Proxmox Web Interface

I also like to shut down the Proxmox web UI when I'm not using it. This keeps the attack surface minimal:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop pveproxy
```

When I need it again:

```bash
sudo systemctl start pveproxy
```

## 🧭 Part 2: Using SSH ProxyJump for Secure Traversal

With the jump server in place, I needed a way to SSH into Proxmox through it — without ever exposing Proxmox’s SSH port to my laptop directly. That’s where **SSH ProxyJump** comes in.

Here’s how I set it up.

### 🔑 SSH Keys with Yubikey (ed25519-sk)

I use a **hardware-backed key stored on a Yubikey**, generated with FIDO2. This adds **physical touch MFA** to SSH authentication.

To create the key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -f ~/.ssh/yub_id_ed25519_sk
```

To copy the public key to the jump box (I temporarily allowed password login just for this):

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/yub_id_ed25519_sk richard@hl_jump
```

This key is required to SSH into the jump box. Once that works, I generate a **second key pair** (also stored securely) for accessing Proxmox from the jump box.

### 🛠 My SSH Config (`~/.ssh/config`)

```ssh
Host hl_jump
    HostName <jump_box_ip>
    User richard
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/hl_jump_key
    IdentitiesOnly yes

Host proxmox-pve
    HostName <proxmox_ip>
    User <your_user>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/proxmox_key
    ProxyJump hl_jump
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

With this config, I can run:

```bash
ssh proxmox-pve
```

...and I’m tunneled securely from my laptop → jump server → Proxmox.

### 🔥 Network Rules

To enforce this flow:

* My **firewall only allows SSH from my laptop to the jump box**
* The **jump box can’t SSH into Proxmox directly** — it only acts as a proxy
* **SSH to Proxmox only works via ProxyJump**, with keys + Yubikey present

This way, if someone ever gets onto the jump box, they still can’t pivot to Proxmox via SSH.

## 🔐 QubesOS: My Final Layer of Key Security

Since I use **QubesOS** on my laptop, I take advantage of its compartmentalization features to protect my SSH keys even further.

### How I Handle SSH Keys in QubesOS

I keep my SSH private keys in a **vault Qube** with **no network access**. When I need to SSH into the jump server, I temporarily move the key into a **networked "work" Qube** that can make the SSH connection.

Here’s how my Qubes setup works:

| Qube    | Role                                      |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `vault` | Holds SSH keys (no network access)        |
| `work`  | Used to SSH into jump box (has network)   |
| `dom0`  | Admin domain, used to copy/move key files |

I also have a small script that moves the key between Qubes when needed. After I'm done working, I move the key back into the vault.

This limits the **exposure window** of my private key, especially if a networked Qube were ever compromised.

## ✅ Final Checklist: What My Setup Looks Like

Here’s what I’ve built with this setup:

| Component          | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 SSH Hardening   | Key-only login, disabled root, tunnels, X11, agent        |
| 🧱 Jump Box        | Single entry point for SSH access into lab                |
| 🔄 SSH ProxyJump   | One-command SSH access to Proxmox through the jump server |
| 🧩 Qubes Vaulting  | Private key is stored offline unless in active use        |
| 🔒 Yubikey MFA     | Physical presence required to use SSH keys                |
| 🚫 Web UI Disabled | Web interface is offline by default                       |

## 🏁 Conclusion

Is this overkill? For some, maybe. But for me, this setup strikes the right balance between **security, usability, and control**.

You don’t have to adopt every part of it — maybe you just harden SSH, or maybe you go all the way with Qubes and hardware keys. The key is to **layer your security in a way that fits your risk profile and your workflow**.

This is what works for me. Hopefully it gives you a few ideas to make your own setup stronger — without making it harder to use.
