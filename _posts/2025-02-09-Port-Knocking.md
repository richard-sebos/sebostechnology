## **Introduction**  

Securing SSH access is critical for **home lab users** and **new system administrators** looking to protect their remote servers. One effective way to enhance security is **Port Knocking**, a technique that keeps SSH access hidden until a predefined sequence of connection attempts (or "knocks") is made on specific ports. When the correct sequence is detected, the firewall dynamically allows SSH access.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a **fully functional Port Knocking setup**, ensuring that your SSH server remains hidden from unauthorized access.  

---

## **1. Understanding Port Knocking**  

By default, your SSH service listens on port **22**, which makes it an easy target for **brute-force attacks** and **port scanning**. With **Port Knocking**, your SSH port remains **closed** unless a specific **sequence of connection attempts** is made on predefined ports. Once the correct sequence is received, the firewall temporarily opens SSH access for the client.  

---

## **2. Installing and Configuring knockd**  

### **Step 1: Install knockd**  

For **Debian/Ubuntu**, install `knockd` with:  

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install knockd -y
```  

For **CentOS/RHEL**, use:  

```bash
sudo yum install knock -y
```  

---

### **Step 2: Edit the knockd Configuration File**  

Modify `/etc/knockd.conf` to define the **knocking sequence** and the commands to open or close SSH access:  

```bash
### Open SSH Access  
[openSSH]  
    sequence = 60842,31027,56118  
    seq_timeout = 5  
    command     = /sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT  
    tcpflags    = syn  

### Close SSH Access  
[closeSSH]  
    sequence    = 56118,31027,60842  
    seq_timeout = 5  
    command     = /sbin/iptables -D INPUT -s %IP% -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT  
    tcpflags    = syn  
```  

💡 **Tip:** You can modify the `sequence` values to any ports of your choice for additional security.  

---

### **Step 3: Enable knockd on Startup**  

Edit `/etc/default/knockd` to ensure the service runs on boot:  

```bash
START_KNOCKD=1  
KNOCKD_OPTS="-i ens18"
```  

💡 **Tip:** Use `ip a` to find your network interface if unsure.  

---

## **3. Adjusting Firewall Rules**  

Before enabling Port Knocking, modify your **iptables** rules:  

### ✅ **Allow Established Connections**  

To prevent active SSH sessions from being interrupted:  

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```  

### ❌ **Block SSH by Default**  

Until the correct knock sequence is received, **block all SSH traffic**:  

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j REJECT
```  

---

## **4. Enabling and Starting knockd with systemctl**  

### **Reload Systemd Daemon**  

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```  

### **Enable knockd to Start at Boot**  

```bash
sudo systemctl enable knockd
```  

### **Start the knockd Service**  

```bash
sudo systemctl start knockd
```  

### **Verify knockd Status**  

```bash
sudo systemctl status knockd
```  

If successful, you should see **"active (running)"**. 🚀  

---

## **5. Testing Port Knocking**  

From your **client machine**, install `knock` and send the **openSSH** sequence:  

```bash
knock -v your-server-ip 60842 31027 56118
```  

Now, try **SSH access**:  

```bash
ssh user@your-server-ip
```  

To **lock SSH** again:  

```bash
knock -v your-server-ip 56118 31027 60842
```  

Your **SSH access should now be revoked**! 🎉

## **Next Steps: Automating Port Knocking**  

While this setup is effective, **using the same knock sequence indefinitely** can pose a security risk. A more advanced approach involves **automatically rotating knock sequences** using a **systemd timer**.
