When running automated processes like **Ansible** playbooks via systemd timers or cron jobs, securely managing sensitive information, such as passwords, becomes crucial. This information must remain encrypted at rest and be securely decrypted during runtime. Here’s a guide to handling this challenge effectively.
Here’s a Markdown table of contents for the blog post:

### The Challenge of Secure Password Management

The key question is: **How can passwords or sensitive information be stored and accessed securely during runtime?** While there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, the method you choose should balance security, simplicity, and practicality.

---

### Using Password Files with Strict Permissions

One common approach is to store the password in a file with strict permissions so that only the application requiring it can access it. For example:

```bash
echo "securE-p@ssw0rd" > password_file.txt
chmod 600 password_file.txt
sudo chown app_owner:app_owner password_file.txt
```

In this setup:
- The file’s permissions (`chmod 600`) ensure only the owner can read or write to it.
- The ownership (`chown`) restricts access to the application user.

**Important Note:** The password file should not have an obvious name like `password_file.txt`. Use a non-descriptive name to avoid drawing attention to its purpose.

### Generating Passwords with SSH Keys and Hashing Tools

An interesting alternative is to derive a password from an **SSH key** using a hashing tool. This method creates a repeatable, secure password without storing it in plaintext:

```bash
## Create a test SSH authentication key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f innocent_file

## Use hashing tool to generate a password
echo $(cat innocent_file | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}')
```

For example, hashing the key file might generate a password like:

```
604e8f705bdb411ff3813e4fd536a52e6e25545d3ff5ea6d038d460e84201c88
```

### Using Ansible Vault with a Hashed Password

Ansible provides a built-in solution for encrypting sensitive information: **Ansible Vault**. This approach allows you to securely store and use sensitive data in playbooks.

#### Creating an Encrypted File
You can create an encrypted file using the hashed password:

```bash
ansible-vault create encrypted_file --vault-password-file <(echo $(cat innocent_file | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}'))
```

#### Using the Encrypted File in a Playbook
When running a playbook, provide the vault password as a hashed value:

```bash
ansible-playbook <some_file>.yml --vault-password-file <(echo $(cat innocent_file | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}'))
```

#### Example Workflow
In one implementation, the `innocent_file` (SSH key) was generated on a separate server. It was securely transferred to the Ansible server when needed and deleted after use. This added an extra layer of security by ensuring the password was ephemeral.

---

### Is This a Serious Solution?

The SSH key-based approach is not a universal solution but has its use cases:
- **Pros**:
  - Quick and easy for generating secure passwords.
  - No need to store plaintext passwords on disk.
  - Repeatable and deterministic.

- **Cons**:
  - Relies on securing the SSH key file (`innocent_file`).
  - Requires additional steps for transferring and managing the key file.
  - Might not meet compliance standards for environments requiring long-term key management.

For environments with stringent security requirements, more robust solutions like a **secrets manager** (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) might be better suited.

### Encrypting Files at Rest

Encrypting files at rest is a fundamental security practice. Ansible Vault is a powerful tool for this purpose, offering seamless integration with Ansible workflows. For non-Ansible processes, consider using tools like **GPG** or **OpenSSL** to encrypt sensitive files before storing them.

Example using GPG:
```bash
gpg --output encrypted_file.gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 sensitive_file.txt
```

To decrypt at runtime:
```bash
gpg --decrypt encrypted_file.gpg > sensitive_file.txt
```

### Final Thoughts

Securely managing sensitive information in automated workflows requires a thoughtful approach. Whether you choose password files, hashed keys, or secrets management solutions, always assess your security needs and operational constraints. The methods outlined here provide a good starting point, but remember: **there’s no substitute for a well-designed security strategy.**
