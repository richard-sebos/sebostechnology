## Introduction

In [the last article](https://richard-sebos.github.io/sebostechnology/posts/CUPS/), I introduced what CUPS (Common Unix Printing System) is and how, even in today's highly digital landscape, printing still plays a key role in supporting business processes. In this article, we’ll take the next step by exploring how to configure user access in CUPS through **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to enhance security and control.

## Understanding RBAC and Its Role in CUPS

RBAC, or Role-Based Access Control, is a method of managing user access by assigning permissions based on roles rather than individuals. In simple terms, it means restricting what a user—or group of users—can do based on what their job function requires or the level of access needed within a system, device, or application.

Why is this needed? Let’s explore that in the context of CUPS.

## CUPS User Roles and Access Levels

A good way to understand RBAC is through examples. Let’s break down CUPS user responsibilities into three distinct roles:

* **End Users**: These could be cashiers, managers, or team leads in a warehouse. They either manually print documents or use applications that automatically send print jobs. Typically located near printers, their primary needs include verifying if a job was sent, checking on slow jobs, and reprinting if something goes wrong.

* **Help Desk**: This is the first line of support when end users encounter issues they can’t solve. Help desk users may need to move jobs to another printer, cancel pending jobs, or perform most of the actions available to end users.

* **Admins**: Admins provide second-level support and are responsible for maintaining and configuring CUPS across the enterprise. They handle tasks like adding or removing printers, analyzing logs, and resolving escalated issues. Admins can do everything help desk and end users can do, and more.

Under RBAC, each role receives an appropriate level of access. End users have the least privileges, while admins have the most. However, RBAC isn’t about status or hierarchy. Without end users, the help desk and admins have no one to support. Without admins, the help desk and users wouldn't have functioning systems. And, let’s face it—sometimes it’s better if some admins never directly interact with users.

## User Authentication in CUPS

CUPS supports multiple authentication types: **Basic**, **Digest**, and **Kerberos**, depending on the version. Digest authentication may be deprecated in some versions, and Kerberos typically requires integration with Active Directory or similar centralized user authentication. For the purposes of this article, we’ll stick with **Basic authentication**.

With Basic authentication, CUPS uses the default Linux authentication system. Users are assigned to Linux groups, and those groups are then mapped to CUPS roles:

* `cups_viewer` – End Users
* `cups_help_desk` – Help Desk
* `cups_admin` – Admins

To assign a user to the end user role, you would run the following command:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG cups_viewer <user id>
```

So, how does CUPS enforce these roles?

## Locations and Policies in CUPS

CUPS uses Apache-style configuration syntax. Within the configuration files, two key directives help manage RBAC:

* `Location` – defines where access is granted (relative to the CUPS web interface)
* `Policy` – defines what actions users can perform once access is granted

### Location Tags

At first glance, you might assume `Location` refers to geographic or network location. However, in CUPS, it refers to URL paths on the web interface.

For example:

* `<Location />` refers to the CUPS home page
* `<Location /admin>` refers to the administration page

To allow the `cups_admin` group to access the administration page, the following configuration can be used:

```bash
<Location /admin>
  AuthType Basic
  Require group cups_admin
  Allow localhost
  Allow 192.168.20.0/24
  Allow 192.168.35.0/24
  Order deny,allow
  Encryption Required
</Location>
```

For a general login to the CUPS home page with basic user access, you can use a catch-all rule:

```bash
<Location />
  Order allow,deny
  Allow localhost
  Allow 192.168.20.0/24
  Allow 192.168.35.0/24
  AuthType Basic
  Require valid-user
  Encryption Required
</Location>
```

So, `Location` defines **where** a user can go. But `Policy` defines **what** they can do once they get there.

### Policy Tags and Action Limits

Policy blocks let you define named access rules. Inside these, you can use one or more `Limit` blocks to control access to specific CUPS actions.

Here’s an example policy for the help desk role:

```bash
<Policy help_desk>
  <Limit Pause-Printer Resume-Printer Enable-Printer Disable-Printer Pause-Printer-After-Current-Job Hold-New-Jobs Release-Held-New-Jobs Deactivate-Printer Activate-Printer Restart-Printer Shutdown-Printer Startup-Printer Promote-Job Schedule-Job-After Cancel-Jobs CUPS-Accept-Jobs CUPS-Reject-Jobs Cancel-Job CUPS-Authenticate-Job>
    AuthType Basic
    Require group cups_help_desk
    Encryption Required
    Order deny,allow
  </Limit>
</Policy>
```

The actions listed inside `<Limit>` are predefined by CUPS. With this configuration, a user in the `cups_help_desk` group can access `/printers`, and once there, they can select a printer and perform the defined actions like pausing or resuming jobs.

Interestingly, different `Limit` blocks within the same `Policy` can be tied to different users or groups, giving you flexibility to finely control access.

## When RBAC in CUPS Is Necessary

So, is RBAC truly needed for CUPS? It depends on your environment.

In a home setup, small business, or basic lab with just a few printers, all three roles (end user, help desk, admin) might be performed by the same individual. In such cases, RBAC may add unnecessary complexity.

However, in larger businesses—especially those with multiple locations and shared network printers—RBAC becomes essential. It not only protects printer queues from accidental or malicious misuse but also ensures users, help desk, and admins can work together efficiently to keep operations running smoothly.
