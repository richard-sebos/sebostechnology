In a previous blog post, I discussed [SSH Proxy Jump](https://dev.to/sebos/proxmox-security-seriesssh-through-firewall-405f), a method that allows SSH traffic to be routed through another server. In this article, we will explore **SSH Tunneling**, a similar but distinct concept. While SSH Proxy Jump routes SSH traffic through an intermediary server, SSH Tunneling takes things a step further by securing traffic between two machines using SSH encryption.

## What is SSH Tunneling?

SSH Tunneling is a method of sending non-SSH traffic securely between two computers by encrypting it through an SSH connection. It is commonly used to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data being transmitted over the network.

While the traffic could already be encrypted (for instance, **Remote Desktop Protocol** or RDP), SSH Tunneling can also encrypt traffic that is typically not secure, such as **File Transfer Protocol** (FTP). For example, when using **FTPS**, the FTP traffic is already encrypted, but SSH Tunneling can still add an extra layer of security, ensuring the data remains private as it traverses the network.

## How Does SSH Tunneling Work?

In an SSH Tunnel, the application on the local computer sends traffic to a specified port. In the background, the SSH client listens for traffic on that port and then forwards it to the default SSH port (usually port 22) to establish a secure connection. Once the traffic reaches the remote machine, it is forwarded to the target application’s port.

Here’s how this works step by step:
1. The application on your local machine sends traffic to a designated port.
2. SSH, running in the background, listens for traffic on that port.
3. The traffic is then forwarded securely to the SSH port (usually port 22).
4. The remote server receives the traffic and forwards it to the application’s port.

This process ensures that the traffic is encrypted and secure, protecting sensitive data from eavesdropping or tampering during transmission.

## How to Use SSH Tunneling

One of the most common use cases for SSH Tunneling is accessing remote systems securely. For example, you can use it to access a **Remote Desktop** (RDP) service on a remote server.

Here is an example command for creating an SSH tunnel to access a remote machine via RDP:

```bash
ssh -p 2222 -L 3389:localhost:3389 richard@192.168.116.2
```

Let’s break down the command:
- `-p 2222`: Specifies the port to connect to on the remote server.
- `-L 3389:localhost:3389`: Sets up the local port forwarding. This means traffic sent to port 3389 on the local machine will be forwarded to port 3389 on the remote machine through the SSH tunnel.
- `richard@192.168.116.2`: Specifies the user and IP address of the remote machine.

After running this command, you can open your RDP application and connect to the remote machine as if it were directly accessible.

## Simplifying SSH Tunneling with the `.ssh/config` File

To make SSH tunneling easier and more convenient, you can configure it in your **`~/.ssh/config`** file. This allows you to avoid typing long commands and simplifies the process of initiating the tunnel.

Here’s how to configure the `.ssh/config` file:

```bash
Host rdp_desktop
    HostName 192.168.116.2
    User richard
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/keys/zta_desktop/zta_desktop
    LocalForward 3389 localhost:3389
```

In this configuration:
- **`Host`**: Defines a shortcut name for the SSH connection (in this case, `rdp_desktop`).
- **`HostName`**: Specifies the IP address or hostname of the remote server.
- **`User`**: Defines the user to authenticate as on the remote machine.
- **`IdentityFile`**: Specifies the path to your private SSH key for authentication (optional).
- **`LocalForward`**: Sets up the port forwarding (in this case, forwarding port 3389 from localhost to the remote machine).

Once this is configured, you can start the tunnel with a simple command:

```bash
ssh rdp_desktop
```

This makes it much easier to manage your SSH tunneling connections, especially when working with multiple remote machines.

## When Should You Use SSH Tunneling?

SSH Tunneling is most beneficial when you need to establish a secure connection between your local system and a remote machine, particularly when you are dealing with sensitive data. Here are a few common use cases:
- **Encrypting unencrypted traffic**: SSH Tunnels are useful when you need to secure traffic that is typically unencrypted, such as FTP.
- **Bypassing firewalls or restrictions**: Tunneling can be used to bypass network restrictions or firewalls that block certain protocols.
- **Protecting network traffic**: If you are concerned about eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks, SSH Tunneling provides an encrypted channel to secure your data.

If you’ve ever been worried about the security of your network traffic, SSH Tunneling provides a robust solution to ensure your data is transmitted safely.

### Conclusion

In summary, SSH Tunneling is a powerful tool for securing traffic between local and remote systems, even when the traffic itself isn’t encrypted. By using SSH’s secure channel to route non-secure traffic, you can protect sensitive information from potential threats on the network. Whether you're accessing remote desktops, databases, or other services, SSH Tunneling provides a simple and effective way to secure your communications.
