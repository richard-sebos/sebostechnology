## Running Linux in QEMU for Testing on IBM PowerPC (or x86)

I recently had the chance to work on an **IBM Power 6 system** running Linux—a first for me. While I’ve spent years working with x86 and ARM systems, **PowerPC architecture** was uncharted territory until now.

The need came up during a project involving a critical application where we had to validate compatibility with Power architecture. Rather than using the actual hardware (and tying it up), I fired up a **QEMU virtual machine** on my MacBook Pro M3 to simulate the environment.

Surprisingly, it worked beautifully: fast to build, simple to configure, and perfect for quick app validation.

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** This tutorial uses `qemu-system-x86_64` for demo purposes, but the same steps apply for PowerPC—just swap in `qemu-system-ppc`.
Absolutely! Here's a **Table of Contents** you can include at the top of your Dev.to article. It’s formatted for Markdown and uses anchor-style links that are compatible with Dev.to’s automatic heading linking.

If you're a developer or systems engineer looking to **test Linux on different architectures** or just need a **portable virtual machine** for experimentation, this guide will walk you through **creating a QEMU VM from an ISO file and a blank QCOW2 disk**.

---

## 🔍 Why Build a Custom QCOW2 Image?

Sure, many Linux distributions offer **prebuilt QCOW2 cloud images**, but sometimes you need more control.

For instance:
- You’re installing a specialized stack like **ROS 2 on Ubuntu**.
- You want to simulate a different CPU architecture.
- You're building a **portable development lab** on your laptop.

Whatever the case, starting from an ISO gives you a flexible and consistent VM environment.

---

## 🛠 Step 1: Create a Blank QCOW2 Disk

Start by creating a 40GB disk in QCOW2 format:

```bash
qemu-img create -f qcow2 ubuntu-ros2.qcow2 40G
```

### Why QCOW2?

QCOW2 is a smart choice for virtualization:
- Supports snapshots
- Saves disk space through compression
- Lightweight and portable

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Boot the Ubuntu ISO with Your QCOW2 Disk

Now, boot your ISO using QEMU and attach the new disk. This command launches a VM with:

- 4 GB RAM
- 2 vCPUs
- Boot from ISO
- Port forwarding from host port `2222` to VM SSH port `22`

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -m 4G \
  -smp 2 \
  -boot d \
  -cdrom ubuntu-22.04.iso \
  -drive file=ubuntu-ros2.qcow2,format=qcow2 \
  -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
  -device e1000,netdev=net0 \
  -display default,show-cursor=on
```

### Breakdown of the Command

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-m 4G` | Allocates 4GB of memory |
| `-smp 2` | Uses 2 CPU cores |
| `-boot d` | Boots from CD-ROM (ISO) |
| `-cdrom` | Path to your Ubuntu ISO |
| `-drive` | Your blank QCOW2 disk |
| `-netdev` / `-device` | Sets up networking + SSH forwarding |
| `-display` | Shows the VM window with a visible cursor |

Once the Ubuntu installer boots, walk through the installation and select your new disk.

---

## 🔁 Step 3: Reboot into the Installed System

After the install is complete, power down the VM. Now restart it, this time booting from the QCOW2 disk directly:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -m 4G \
  -smp 2 \
  -drive file=ubuntu-ros2.qcow2,format=qcow2 \
  -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 \
  -device e1000,netdev=net0 \
  -display default,show-cursor=on
```

> 🔒 **Security Tip:** If you're planning to SSH into the VM, set up your public SSH key and secure your user account.

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Whether you're testing for **PowerPC compatibility**, building custom environments for embedded systems, or just geeking out with virtualization, **QEMU is an incredibly versatile tool**.

It gives you a high degree of flexibility:
- No need for dedicated servers
- Easily simulate alternate architectures
- Keep your workflows portable and reproducible

With just a few commands, you’ve set up a clean, isolated Linux environment that’s ready for development, debugging, or deployment testing.
