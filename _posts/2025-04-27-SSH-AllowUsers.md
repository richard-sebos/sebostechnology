Securing SSH access is a crucial step in hardening your Linux servers. In our previous discussion, we highlighted the importance of SSH as a secure communication protocol and introduced the `sshd_config` file, the primary configuration point for the SSH daemon. 

In this article, we'll take it a step further by exploring methods to restrict SSH access to specific users and IP addresses. We'll cover three key techniques: **TCP Wrappers**, **AllowUsers/AllowGroups directives**, and **IP restrictions** within `sshd_config`. These methods provide layered security controls, helping ensure that only authorized users from designated sources can access your server.

## What are TCP Wrappers?

**TCP Wrappers** are a host-based access control system that can restrict network services based on IP addresses or hostnames. Although considered **legacy technology**, TCP Wrappers may still be present on some systems and can serve as an additional layer of security. They operate using two configuration files:

- `/etc/hosts.allow`: Specifies which hosts are permitted to access specific services.
- `/etc/hosts.deny`: Specifies which hosts are denied access.

### Example: Allowing a Specific IP

If you want to allow SSH access **only** from a specific IP address, such as `192.168.1.100`, you can configure the following:

**`/etc/hosts.allow`:**
```bash
sshd: 192.168.1.100
```
This explicitly permits SSH connections from `192.168.1.100`.

**`/etc/hosts.deny`:**
```bash
sshd: ALL
```
This denies SSH connections from **all other sources**.

> **Note:** While TCP Wrappers provide basic access control, modern systems often rely on firewalls for similar functionality. For example, with **firewalld**, you can achieve the same restriction:

```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.1.100" service name="ssh" accept'
firewall-cmd --reload
```

Using firewalls is generally preferred for flexibility and scalability, but knowing TCP Wrappers can be helpful in environments where they are still in use.

## AllowUsers and AllowGroups Directives

The **sshd_config** file governs SSH behavior through various directives, two of which—**AllowUsers** and **AllowGroups**—are particularly useful for access control.

- **AllowUsers**: Specifies which user accounts are allowed to access the server via SSH.
- **AllowGroups**: Specifies which user groups are allowed SSH access.

If **both** directives are used, **a user must meet both conditions**—they must be listed in `AllowUsers` *and* belong to one of the groups specified in `AllowGroups`—to successfully connect via SSH.

### Example: Enterprise Group Control

In an enterprise environment, it's common to create a dedicated SSH access group, such as `ssh_users`, and use `AllowGroups` to control access:

```bash
AllowGroups ssh_users
```

If your Linux server is integrated with **Active Directory**, you can manage SSH access centrally by creating an **Active Directory group** and referencing it in `AllowGroups`. This way, only users in that AD group can SSH into the server, simplifying user management.

## IP Restrictions in sshd_config

For more granular control, you can combine **user-based restrictions** with **IP-based conditions** directly in the `sshd_config` file. This is where the **Match Address** block comes into play.

The **Match** directive applies configuration settings only when specific conditions are met, such as a user's IP address.

### Example: Restricting a User by IP

To allow only the user **richard** to SSH from the IP `192.168.1.100`, add the following to `sshd_config`:

```bash
Match Address 192.168.1.100
    AllowUsers richard
```

This ensures that **only richard** can SSH from that specific IP. All other users or connections from other IPs will be denied.

Alternatively, SSH supports **inline IP restrictions** within the `AllowUsers` directive:

```bash
AllowUsers richard@192.168.1.100
```

However, using the **Match Address** block is generally preferred for reliability and clarity, especially when managing complex configurations.

> **Caution:** When working with conditional blocks in `sshd_config`, be careful to structure your directives correctly. Misconfiguration can lock you out of SSH access!

## Conclusion

Securing SSH access is a multi-layered process that goes beyond simply setting up keys or passwords. By using **TCP Wrappers**, **AllowUsers/AllowGroups directives**, and **IP restrictions**, you can significantly reduce the attack surface of your Linux server.

While **TCP Wrappers** offer basic, legacy controls, modern solutions like **firewalld** provide more robust options. Combining **user and group-based restrictions** with **IP-level controls** in `sshd_config` gives you the flexibility to tailor access precisely to your environment's needs.

Remember, defense in depth is key. Use these techniques together to build a solid security posture for your SSH services.
