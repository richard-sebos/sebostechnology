🚀 AppArmor vs. SELinux in ROS2 Development: A Case Study

After facing roadblocks with SELinux on Oracle Linux and Ubuntu, I tested AppArmor for a ROS2 project expecting smoother integration.

What I found:

    AppArmor is simple to set up—but not flexible enough for tools like colcon

    SELinux, though complex, may offer better control in robotic environments

    MAC tools matter deeply when securing build and runtime pipelines

💡 If you're working on robotic systems or secure Linux environments, this post dives into practical lessons and hard-earned insights.

👋 Hey devs and tinkerers—ever struggled with ROS2 security?

I tried setting up AppArmor on Ubuntu after hitting snags with SELinux on Oracle Linux. While AppArmor was easier to use, it just didn’t cut it with tools like colcon.

Tried integrating ROS2 on Oracle Linux with SELinux—no go.
Switched to AppArmor on Ubuntu—easier, yes. Effective? Not quite.

colcon and AppArmor don’t play well together. Turns out, AppArmor’s simplicity can limit it in complex dev environments.

Here’s my story, what didn’t work, and where I’m heading next:

Boosts appreciated if you think secure ROS2 needs better tooling. 🧵

Hit a wall trying to secure #ROS2 with SELinux? I did too. 🤯
Switched to AppArmor—quick setup, but colcon didn't play nice.
