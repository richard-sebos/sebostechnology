🛡️ **From Monitoring to Enforcement: Secure Your ROS2 Robotics Projects!**

After monitoring system activity with **Auditd**, the next step is enforcing real security boundaries with **AppArmor**. In my latest guide, I walk through how to restrict sensitive **ROS2 code access** for tester groups—starting safely in passive mode before enforcing hard restrictions.

If you're serious about **robotics security** and **DevSecOps practices**, this is a must-read!

Hey r/robotics and r/linuxadmin,

Following up on my last post about using Auditd for monitoring ROS2 systems, I’ve now published a hands-on guide for enforcing security with **AppArmor**.

* Learn how to safely start in passive (Complain) mode.
* Monitor access attempts before switching to Enforce mode.
* Block unauthorized access to your ROS2 codebase without disrupting your team.

Would you like me to prep a GitHub `README.md` and repository description for this as well, to complete the content ecosystem?
