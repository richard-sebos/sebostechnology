### 📚 **Should You Publish This on GitHub?**

Yes, publishing it (or at least the supporting scripts and examples) on GitHub is a good idea. You could:

* Create a repository called something like `ros2-security-tools` or `ros2-auditd-examples`.
* Include the full article as a `README.md`.
* Upload the `audit_report.sh` script and any additional example audit rules.

This not only adds credibility but also makes it easy for others to contribute or fork your tools.

📌 **Popular Locations for Sharing GitHub Projects:**

* Add a link in the Dev.to article.
* Share the GitHub repo in your social posts.
* Cross-post to forums like ROS Discourse and Reddit (r/robotics, r/linuxadmin).

Do you want me to generate the GitHub `README.md` for you based on this content?
