# **How to Set Up MFA on Ubuntu 24 Using PAM**

## **Overview**
Ubuntu 24 supports MFA through the PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) system, which allows you to enhance login security by requiring additional authentication factors. This guide focuses on setting up time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) using Google Authenticator.

---

## **Step-by-Step MFA Setup**

### **1. Install Required Packages**
Run the following command to install all necessary packages:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pam-google-authenticator google-authenticator \
python3-pam-google-authenticator python3-google-auth-otp python3-pam-python
```

---

### **2. Set Up Google Authenticator for a User**

Repeat these steps for each user (including `root`) who needs MFA:

1. **Install the Google Authenticator App** on your smartphone (iOS/Android).
2. **Run the setup tool** on the Ubuntu machine:
   ```bash
   google-authenticator
   ```
   - Answer the prompts to generate a QR code and set your MFA preferences.
   - Scan the QR code with your phone app.
   - Save the secret keys and recovery codes securely.

---

### **3. Configure PAM to Enforce MFA**

Edit the PAM configuration for login:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-auth
```

Add the following line at the top *before* any `pam_unix.so` entries:

```bash
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
```

Save and exit.

---

### **4. Secure SSH to Use MFA**

Edit the SSH PAM config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/pam.d/sshd
```

Ensure this line is present:

```bash
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
```

Then edit the SSH daemon configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Update or ensure the following lines are set:

```bash
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
UsePAM yes
```

Restart SSH service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

---

### **5. Test the MFA Setup**

1. Log out and log back in.
2. After entering your username and password, you should be prompted for a verification code from your Google Authenticator app.

---

## **Use Case Examples**

### **Example: Set Up MFA for Root**

```bash
sudo -i
google-authenticator
```
Follow the prompts and complete the PAM and SSH configuration steps above.

### **Example: Set Up MFA for Multiple Users**

Repeat the `google-authenticator` setup for each user account, and ensure PAM configuration is enforced globally.

---

## **Security Best Practices**

- Use strong passwords along with MFA.
- Securely store backup codes.
- Regularly rotate secret keys.
- Educate users on phishing risks.
- Monitor and audit login attempts.
- Keep authentication packages updated.

## **Conclusion**

Setting up MFA with PAM on Ubuntu 24 significantly boosts security by adding a second layer of authentication. Following these steps ensures a robust, flexible solution compatible with modern security standards.
